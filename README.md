# OpenDiscord
 Control your game through Discord chat

## Info
 Program made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity). OpenDiscord uses Discord bot to listen for any messages in any servers it's in and when it recognizes a command it will send a keystroke to your PC as if it came from your keyboard!

 Status: **in active early developement** :)

 Original idea: https://github.com/c4r1sk1m/OpenTwitchPlays

## Limitations
 - Can't send keystrokes to specific window (#2)
 - Doesn't recognize special keys such as Ctrl, Shift, Alt, etc. (#7)

## Supported platforms
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - macOS

 _Note: I build and test only for Windows. I'll start testing on Linux and macOS when I get better PC that can run VM :D_
