# OpenDiscord
 Control your game through Discord chat

## Info
 Pretty fast Discord bot made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity). OpenDiscord bot listens for messages in any guilds/servers it's in and when it recognizes a command it will send a keystroke to your PC as if it came from your keyboard.

 OpenDiscord is still in early developement. If you find any issues please refer to the [Issues](#issues) or [Contribution](#contribution)

 Original idea: https://github.com/c4r1sk1m/OpenTwitchPlays

## Limitations
 - Can't send keystrokes to specific window
 - Doesn't recognize special keys such as Ctrl, Shift, Alt, etc.

These limitations might get resolved later. If you need them now create an issue.

## Setup
 You can learn how to setup OpenDiscord [here](SETUP.md).

## Issues
 If you encounter any bugs create an issue and I'll try to resolve the porblem.

## Contribution
